Funding Opportunity Announcement
Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration
Washington, DC
March 3, 2017

Funding Opportunity Number: SFOP-0001440
Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) number: 19.518 – Overseas Refugee Assistance Programs for Western Hemisphere
Announcement issuance date: Friday, March 3, 2017
Proposal submission deadline: Friday, April 7, 2017 at 12:00 p.m. noon, EDT. We are unable to consider proposals submitted after this deadline.
**ADVISORY: All applicants must submit proposals through the website Grants.gov NOT through GrantsSolutions.gov. Please note that if you apply on the SAMS Domestic site, your application will be disqualified. PRM strongly recommends submitting your proposal early to allow time to address any difficulties that may arise.**
If you are new to PRM funding, the Grants.gov registration process can be complicated. We urge you to refer to PRMâs General NGO Guidelines âNew to PRM Fundingâ section for information and resources to help ensure that the application process runs smoothly. PRM also strongly encourages organizations that have received funding from PRM in the past to read this section as a refresher.


Full Text of Notice of Funding Opportunity
A. Program Description
This announcement is designed to accompany PRMâs General NGO Guidelines which contain additional information on PRMâs priorities and NGO funding strategy with which selected organizations must comply. Please use both the General NGO Guidelines and this announcement to ensure that your submission is in full compliance with PRM requirements and that the proposed activities are in line with PRMâs priorities. Submissions that do not reflect the requirements outlined in these guidelines will not be considered.
Current Funding Priorities:
(a) PRM seeks NGO proposals that primarily support Colombian internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Colombia and Colombian refugees in Panama, Ecuador, and Venezuela. These proposals should fill critical gaps in humanitarian assistance and local integration support for particularly vulnerable asylum seekers and refugees, including women, Afro-Colombians, and indigenous populations. Proposed activities should aim to improve beneficiariesâ self-reliance and form alliances with public institutions to improve their capacity to provide basic services to persons of concern. Within each country, programs should focus on areas with significant populations of refugees and asylum seekers and weak institutional capacity, including in both rural and urban settings. Because of PRM’s mandate to provide protection, assistance, and sustainable solutions for refugees and victims of conflict, PRM will consider funding only those projects that include a target beneficiary base of at least 50 percent refugees/IDPs/other populations of concern.
(b) Proposals must focus on one or more of the following sectors (see PRMâs General NGO Guidelines for sector descriptions):
(i) Protection
(ii) Child protection
(iii) Gender-based violence prevention and response as applicable
(iv) Education
(v) Healthcare (primary only)
(vi) Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)
(vii) Livelihoods
(viii) Emergency shelter
(ix) Nutrition and food security
(x) Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS)
Country-specific Provisions:
Colombian Refugees in Venezuela: PRM seeks proposals that fill critical gaps in humanitarian assistance and local integration support for particularly vulnerable asylum seekers and refugees, including women, Afro-Colombians, and indigenous populations. Proposals should aim to improve beneficiariesâ self-reliance and form alliances with public institutions to provide basic services to the persons of concern. Programs in Venezuela must include a target beneficiary base of at least 50% refugees and asylum seekers in need of international protection. Programs are encouraged to also include assistance to non-refugee vulnerable populations in host communities. PRM partners must coordinate with international organizations and other NGOs in all program areas.
All proposals for programs in Venezuela should address three or more of the priority sectors listed below (not all activities in each sector need to be addressed).

Capacity Building and Institution Strengthening: In cooperation with UNHCR, provide assistance and support to host government entities responsible for registration, documentation, and integration of refugees and other persons of concern. Offer relevant training to local and national government authorities on respect for refugeesâ and asylum seekersâ rights, including to members of the migration police, military, and social service agencies.
Basic Humanitarian Assistance: Targeted provision of food and non-food items, support for access to health services, which can include reproductive health services, mental health and psychosocial assistance per the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) guidelines on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings, and/or emergency shelter assistance.
Protection Mechanisms: Improve protection for vulnerable asylum seekers and refugees through: a) improved access to and awareness of asylum regimes, refugee reception, orientation, registration, and documentation; b) improved access to housing, financial services, and living conditions; c) the promotion of durable solutions that include safe employment; d) the prevention of and response to xenophobia and discrimination against asylum seekers and refugees, including through public outreach; e) addressing gender-based violence; and/or f) child protection, including family reunification, case management, and other child protective resources.
Education: PRM considers activities that fall under the education sector to include those designed to improve girlsâ and boysâ equitable access and enrollment in early childhood education, primary education, and secondary education. To avoid establishing, refugee-specific systems parallel to what already exists locally, programs should seek, wherever possible, to support refugee children through national schools alongside host community students. Activities may be delivered in formal or non-formal settings, and should be accessible to and inclusive of children with different types of disabilities.
Livelihoods: Provide opportunities for income generation, skills training, and/or job placement. Programs must be based on basic market assessments, and these assessments must be included in the proposal. Proposals must also include a beneficiary capacity/capability assessment. Programs should also conduct a risk assessment of proposed activities, including an assessment of potential for labor exploitation. If appropriate, programs should plan for risk mitigation techniques, including transportation allowances and childcare and assist in licensing and permitting procedures as necessary/required/permitted.
Vocational training programs: We encourage partnerships with private enterprises that have identified the need to hire workers with the specific skill sets, required, as well as employment counseling components and maintenance of job banks. Proposals from organizations that implemented PRM-funded livelihoods programs in previous years must include information on previous program beneficiariesâ income and employment status.
Social Integration Activities: Promote socio-cultural integration activities to build relations and foster cooperation between refugees and host communities. Organize integration activities for vulnerable youth, especially those who are at risk of forced recruitment into criminal groups, linking them to livelihoods activities and/or formal education.

Priority geographic areas for Venezuela include: Apure, Caracas, Merida, Tachira, Zulia, Amazonas, Miranda, Trujillo and Barinas.
(b) Colombian refugees in Ecuador: PRM seeks proposals that fill critical gaps in humanitarian assistance and local integration support for particularly vulnerable asylum seekers and refugees, including women, Afro-Colombians, and indigenous populations. Proposals should aim to improve beneficiariesâ self-reliance and form alliances with public institutions to provide basic services to the persons of concern. Programs in Ecuador must include a target beneficiary base of at least 50% refugees and asylum seekers in need of international protection. Programs are encouraged to also include assistance to non-refugee vulnerable populations in host communities.

Priority geographic areas for Panama: Panama City and Colon.
(d) Colombian IDPs: PRM seeks proposals from organizations with a proven track record of providing humanitarian assistance in Colombia in the past 24 months. Proposals must address all priority thematic and geographic sectors listed below during the immediate and emergency phases of displacement (approximately the first 90 days following displacement) and address gaps in the provision of such assistance for vulnerable IDPs, including women, Afro-Colombians, and indigenous populations. PRM funding priorities also include improving the response capacity of the Colombian government at the local and national levels to provide protection and assistance to IDPs in an effort to implement the Victims and Land Restitution Law (Victims Law). Organizations proposing to work in the immediate phase of assistance (during which beneficiaries have not yet been formally included in the governmentâs Victims Registry) must explicitly state in their proposal how beneficiaries will be identified, as well as which standards the program will apply in evaluating whether a person meets the definition of conflict-displaced.
In addition to describing general coordination, proposals from organizations operating in areas where USAID programs are being implemented should specifically describe in their proposals any coordination efforts already underway. Note: Partners selected for funding will be required to coordinate with USAID, as well as with international organizations and NGOs, if operating in the same geographic regions.
Proposals in Colombia should address all of the sectors listed below (not all activities in each sector need to be addressed) and include phase-out indicators and knowledge-sharing strategies for local authorities/organizations to continue initiatives beyond the program timelines.

Immediate and Emergency Humanitarian Assistance: Provide food and non-food assistance to newly displaced for up to 90 days. Provide basic health screenings, which can include reproductive health, mental health, and psychosocial support per IASC Guidelines. Provide emergency shelter assistance. All proposals must include transition plans that detail specific benchmarks and a timeline for transitioning activities/services to government entities, local NGOs, development organizations, or to the community by the end of the project period.
Capacity Building and Institution Strengthening:
Local Level: Coordinate with municipalities in the delivery of immediate assistance to IDPs and work with municipalities on Victims Action Plans to plan and budget for providing humanitarian assistance. Advise and support local officials on how to benefit from co-funding mechanisms and help them access additional funding from the Victims Unit and other national agencies. Coordinate with the Victims Unit at the local level. Channel beneficiaries into government programs through registration of displacement claims and work with the government to ensure that IDPs receiving assistance are registered in the Victims Registry. Improve the governmentâs response capacity to provide the first phase of assistance through support and training for mayors and other elected officials, municipalities, local victimsâ centers, and IDP integrated assistance centers. Host information-sharing sessions among municipalities for mayors and local authorities to exchange best practices on the delivery of immediate assistance to IDPs (including IDP associations when feasible). Involve municipal governments in the hand-off of mid- to long-term assistance to the Victims Unit. Support emergency projects that will improve local authoritiesâ capacity to prevent and respond to displacement, such as community centers and shelters.
National Level: Coordinate with relevant entities at the national level, such as the Victims Unit, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Agriculture, and Public Ministry, in the identification and support of initiatives and projects that will help improve the governmentâs IDP policy and program response. Ensure that feedback mechanisms among the local, regional, and national levels are in place and working efficiently. Proposals should explicitly address how the proposed program aligns with the priorities of the Victims Unit, and particularly the Sub Directorates for Prevention and Emergency Response (Subdireccion de Prevention y Atencion de Emergencias) and for Humanitarian Assistance and Attention (Subdireccion de Asistencia y Atencion Humanitaria), preferably via consultation with personnel of these sub directorates. Possible priorities include assistance in the development of contingency plans and Territorial Action Plans.
Civil Society: Strengthen the organization and activities of IDP associations and social organizations, including Transitional Justice Committees and networks of host community residents, to protect and promote the rights of IDPs. Support cooperation between municipalities and IDP associations and encourage the participation of IDPs in government decision-making entities. Support IDPsâ participation in community activities and in government policies and programs designed for IDPsâ benefit.


Protection Mechanisms: Improve protection for IDPs through access to IDP registration and assistance that will improve living conditions and promote durable solutions. Strengthen mechanisms to link beneficiaries with government assistance programs and services in order to promote the effective enjoyment of rights, including community strengthening activities. Address discrimination in IDP host communities by developing educational campaigns in cooperation with host communities. Address gender-based violence. Promote integration activities in urban communities.

Geographic Coverage: Areas of focus should include zones with high levels of displacement and weak institutional capacity. The selection of geographic locations should take into consideration the presence of government services, ICRC humanitarian assistance, and other emergency assistance programs supported by international donors (such as WFP, ECHO, etc.) to avoid duplication, with priority consideration given to the following departments: Antioquia, Arauca, CaquetÃ¡, Cauca, Choco, Cordoba, Guaviare, NariÃ±o, Norte de Santander, Meta, Putumayo, and Valle del Cauca.
B. Federal Award Information
Proposed program start dates: September 1-29, 2017

Applicants may submit multi-year proposals with activities and budgets that do not exceed two years (24 months) from the proposed start date. Actual awards will not exceed one year (12 months) in duration and activities and budgets submitted in year one can be revised/updated each year. Continued funding after the initial 12- month award requires the submission of a noncompeting single year proposal and will be contingent upon available funding, strong performance, and continuing need. In funding a project one year, PRM makes no representations that it will continue to fund the project in successive years and encourages applicants to seek a wide array of donors to ensure long-term funding possibilities. Please see Multi-Year Funding section below for additional information. Livelihoods projects are encouraged to be multi-year.
Funding Limits: Project proposals must be not less than $500,000 per year, and be no more than $3,000,000 per year or they will be disqualified.

D. Application and Submission Instructions
1. Address to Request Application Package:
(a) Application packages may be downloaded from the website www.Grants.gov .
2. Content and Form of Application:
(a) PRM strongly recommends using the proposal and budget templates that are available upon email request from PRM’s NGO Coordinator (PRMNGOCoordinator@state.gov). Please send an email, with the phrase âPRM NGO Templatesâ in the subject line, to PRM’s NGO Coordinator to receive an automated reply with the templates.
Page limits: Single-year proposals using PRMâs templates must be no more than 15 pages in length (Times New Roman 12 point font, one inch margins on all sides). If the applicant does not use PRMâs recommended templates, proposals must not exceed 10 pages in length. Organizations may choose to attach work plans, activity calendars, and/or logical frameworks as addendums/appendices to the proposal. These attachments do not count toward the page limit total however annexes cannot be relied upon as a key source of program information. The proposal narrative must be able to stand on its own in the application process. For multi-year funding application instructions, see section (e) below. Proposals exceeding the page limit cannot be considered.
(b) To be considered for PRM funding, organizations must submit a complete application package including:

Proposal narrative reflecting objectives and indicators for each year of the program period.
Budget and budget narrative for each year of the program period.
Signed completed SF-424, including SF-424A and SF-424B.
Risk Analysis.

(c) Additionally, organizations must submit the following documents as part of their proposal package, if applicable:

Organizations applying for livelihoods project funding must include both a market analysis and a beneficiary competency/capacity assessment as part of the proposal package. Please see the General NGO Guidelines for more details.
Most recent Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement (NICRA), if applicable or a de minimis rate calculation if the applicant elects to use the de minimis rate, if applicable.
NGOs that have not received PRM funding since the U.S. government fiscal year ending September 30, 2004 must be prepared to demonstrate that they meet the financial and accounting requirements of the U.S. government by submitting copies of 1) the most recent external financial audit, 2) proof of non-profit tax status including under IRS 501 (c)(3), as applicable, 3) a Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, and 4) an Employer ID (EIN)/Federal Tax Identification number, as applicable.
Organizations that received PRM funding in FY 2016 for activities that are being proposed for funding under this announcement must include the most recent quarterly progress report against indicators outlined in the cooperative agreement. If an organizationâs last quarterly report was submitted more than six weeks prior to the submission of a proposal in response to this funding announcement, the organization must include, with its most recent quarterly report, updates that show any significant progress made on objectives since the last report.

(d) In order to be considered a competitive proposal, the proposal narrative should include the following information:

Focus on outcome or impact indicators as much as possible. At a minimum, each objective should have one outcome or impact indicator. Wherever possible, baselines should be established before the start of the project.
Include Specific information on locations of projects and beneficiaries (GPS coordinates if possible) to increase PRMâs ability to track the impact of PRM funding.
Outline how the NGO will acknowledge PRM funding. If an organization believes that publicly acknowledging the receipt of USG funding for a particular PRM-funded project could potentially endanger the lives of the beneficiaries and/or the organization staff, invite suspicion about the organization’s motives, or alienate the organization from the population it is trying to help, it must provide a brief explanation in its proposal as to why it should be exempted from this requirement.
The budget should include a specific breakdown of funds being provided by UNHCR, other USG agencies, other donors, and your own organization.
Applicants whose proposals address gender-based violence (GBV) through their projects must estimate the total cost of these activities as a separate line item in their proposed budgets (see PRMâs budget template). Proposals and budgets must include details of any sub-agreements associated with the program.
PRM partners must complete a gender analysis in the proposal narrative that briefly explains (1) Experiences of men, women, boys, and girls with a focus on the different familial roles, community privileges, and gender dynamics within the target population; (2) associated risks and threats experienced by women, girls, and other vulnerable populations based on their gender; (3) power imbalances and needs that arise based on gender inequalities that exist within the family or community; and (4) proposed responses that will address the above and mitigate any gender differences in access, participation, or decision-making that may be experienced by at-risk groups, particularly women and girls. The gender analysis should aim to specify and target specific at-risk sub-populations of women and girls, in particular women and girl heads of households, out-of-school girls, women and girls with disabilities, women and girl survivors of violence, married girls, adolescent mothers, as well as people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or intersex (LGBTI), and those who are often unaware of and excluded from programs and services and who may be the hardest to reach based on their gender.
Summarize the risk analysis in the security and risk management section of the proposal narrative.

(e) We will ask applicants to submit the following documents before a cooperative agreement is finalized:

Copy of the organizationâs Code of Conduct.
Copy of the organizationâs Security Plan.
Copy of the organizationâs Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) framework.
Completed PRM Award Data Sheet.

(f) Multi-Year Funding: Applicants proposing multi-year programs should adhere to the following guidance:
Applicants may submit proposals that include multi-year strategies presented in one year (12-month) cycles for a period not to exceed two years (24 months) from the proposed start date. Fully developed programs with detailed budgets, objectives and indicators are required for each year of activities. Applicants should use PRMâs recommended multi-year proposal template for the first year of a multi-year application. Multi-year funding applicants may use PRMâs standard budget template and should submit a separate budget sheet for each project year. Multi-year proposal narratives and budgets can be updated yearly upon submission of new noncompeting single year proposal narrative template with an updated budget, each year.
Page limits: Multi-year proposals using PRMâs multi-year template must be no more than 20 pages in length (Times New Roman 12 point font, one inch margins on all sides). If the applicant does not use PRMâs recommended templates, proposals must not exceed 15 pages in length. Organizations may choose to attach work plans, activity calendars, and/or logical frameworks as addendums/appendices to the proposal. These attachments do not count toward the page limit total however annexes cannot be relied upon as a key source of program information. The proposal narrative must be able to stand on its own in the application process. Proposals exceeding the page limit cannot be considered.
Multi-year applications selected for funding by PRM will be funded in one year (12- month) increments based on the proposal submitted in the initial application as approved by PRM. Continued funding after the initial 12- month award requires the submission of a noncompeting single year proposal narrative and will be contingent upon available funding, strong performance, and continuing need. Follow-on funding applications must be submitted by the organization no later than 90 days before the proposed start date of the new award (e.g., if the next project period is to begin on September 1, submit your application by June 1). Follow-on year applications are submitted in lieu of responding to PRMâs published call for proposals for those activities. Late submissions will jeopardize continued funding.
Organizations can request single-year and multi-year funding proposal narrative templates by emailing PRM’s NGO Coordinator with the phrase âPRM NGO Templatesâ in the subject line.
3. Dun and Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number and System for Award Management (SAM)
(a) Each applicant is required to: (i) be registered in SAM before submitting its application; (ii) provide a valid DUNS number in its application; and (iii) continue to maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times during which it has an active PRM award or an application or plan under consideration by PRM. No federal award may be made to an applicant until the applicant has complied with all applicable DUNS and SAM requirements and, if an applicant has not fully complied with the requirements by the time the PRM award is ready to be made, PRM may determine that the applicant is not qualified to receive a PRM award and use that determination as a basis for making a PRM award to another applicant.
(b) Proposals must be submitted via Grants.gov (not via SAMS Domestic). Grants.gov registration requires a DUNS number and active SAM.gov registration. If you are new to PRM funding, the Grants.gov registration process can be complicated. We urge you to refer to PRMâs General NGO Guidelines âNew to PRM Fundingâ section for information and resources to help ensure that the application process runs smoothly. PRM also strongly encourages organizations that have received funding from PRM in the past to read this section as a refresher. Applicants may also refer to the âApplicant Resources â tools and tips page on Grants.gov for complete details on requirements.
(c) Do not wait until the last minute to submit your application on Grants.gov. Organizations not registered with Grants.gov should register well in advance of the deadline as it can take up to two weeks to finalize registration (sometimes longer for non-U.S. based NGOs to get the required registration numbers). We also recommend that organizations, particularly first-time applicants, submit applications via Grants.gov no later than one week before the deadline to avoid last-minute technical difficulties that could result in an application not being considered. PRM partners must maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times during which they have an active federal award or an application under consideration by PRM or any federal agency.
(d) When registering with Grants.gov , organizations must designate points of contact and Authorized Organization Representatives (AORs). Organizations based outside the United States must also request and receive an NCAGE  code prior to registering with SAM.gov . Applicants experiencing technical difficulties with the SAM registration process should contact the Federal Service Desk  (FSD) online or at 1-866-606-8220 (U.S.) and 1-334-206-7828 (International).
(e) Applications must be submitted under the authority of the Authorized Organization Representative at the applicant organization. Having proposals submitted by agency headquarters helps to avoid possible technical problems.
(f) If you encounter technical difficulties with Grants.gov please contact the Grants.gov Help Desk at support@grants.gov or by calling 1-800-518-4726.
(g) It is the responsibility of each applicant to ensure the appropriate registrations are in place and active. Failure to have the appropriate organizational registrations in place is not considered a technical difficulty and is not justification for an alternate means of submission.
(h) Pursuant to U.S. Code, Title 218, Section 1001, stated on OMB Standard Form 424 (SF-424), the Department of State is authorized to consolidate the certifications and assurances required by Federal law or regulations for its federal assistance programs. The list of certifications and assurances can be found here .
(i) In accordance with 2 CFR Â§200.113, Mandatory disclosures, the non-Federal entity or applicant for a Federal award must disclose, in a timely manner, in writing to the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity all violations of Federal criminal law involving fraud, bribery, or gratuity violations potentially affecting the Federal award.

7. Other Submission Requirements
(a) PRM Standardized Indicators: In an effort to streamline the proposal writing/reviewing process and better measure the impact of the Bureauâs work, PRM requires the use of standardized indicators for projects in the protection, child protection, health, mental health and psychosocial support, WASH, nutrition and food security, education, livelihoods, and emergency shelter sectors, as well as projects that include local government capacity-building and core relief items (non-food items). Applicants must fill in numerical and/or percentage targets for each indicator. Sphere standards should be used as targets, unless otherwise noted. Proposals must include all standardized indicators that apply to the program. Please refer to PRMâs General NGO Guidelines for a complete list of all standardized indicators that must be included.
(d) Branding and Marking Strategy: Unless exceptions have been approved by the designated bureau Authorizing Official as described in the proposal templates that are available upon email request from PRM’s NGO Coordinator, at a minimum, the following provision will be included whenever assistance is awarded:

â¢ The Recipient shall recognize the United States Governmentâs funding for activities specified under this award at the project site with a graphic of the U.S. flag accompanied by one of the following two phrases based on the level of funding for the award:
1) Fully funded by the award: âGift of the United States Governmentâ
2) Partially funded by the award: âFunding provided by the United States Governmentâ

Exemptions from this requirement may be allowable but must be agreed to in writing by the Grants Officer.
All programs, projects, assistance, activities, and public communications to foreign audiences, partially or fully funded by the Department, should be marked appropriately overseas with the standard U.S. flag in a size and prominence equal to (or greater than) any other logo or identity. The requirement does not apply to the Recipientâs own corporate communications or in the United States.
The Recipient should ensure that all publicity and promotional materials underscore the sponsorship by or partnership with the U.S. Government or the U.S. Embassy. The Recipient may continue to use existing logos or program materials; however, a standard rectangular U.S. flag must be used in conjunction with such logos.
The U.S. flag may replace or be used in conjunction with the Department of State seal, the U.S. embassy seal, or other DOS program logos.
Sub non-Federal entities (sub-awardees) and subsequent tier sub-award agreements are subject to the marking requirements and the non-Federal entity shall include a provision in the sub non-Federal entity agreement indicating that the standard, rectangular U.S. flag is a requirement.
In the event the non-Federal entity does not comply with the marking requirements as established in the approved assistance agreement, the Grants Officer Representative and the Grants Officer must initiate corrective action with the non-Federal entity.
E. Application Review Information
1. Criteria: Eligible submissions will be those that comply with the criteria and requirements included in this announcement. In addition, the review panel will evaluate the proposals based on the following criteria:
(i) Problem Statement/Analysis
(ii) Program Description
(iii) Gender Analysis
(iv) Objectives and Indicators
(v) Monitoring and Evaluation Plan
(vi) Accountability to Affected Populations
(vii) Coordination
(viii) Sustainability and Capacity-Building
(ix) Management and Past Performance
(x) Budget
2. PRM will conduct a formal competitive review of all proposals submitted in response to this funding announcement. A review panel of at least three people will evaluate submissions based on the above-referenced programmatic criteria and PRM priorities in the context of available funding.
3. Department of State Review Panels may provide conditions and recommendations on applications to enhance the proposed program, which must be addressed by the applicant before further consideration of the award. To ensure effective use of limited PRM funds, conditions or recommendations may include requests to increase, decrease, clarify, and/or justify costs and program activities.
4. New PRM Award Data Sheet: Prior to award and upon final negotiation, PRM will ask the selected NGOs to fill out and submit a PRM Award Data Sheet to capture a subset of information from the proposal.
F. Federal Award Administration Information
1. Federal Award Administration. A successful applicant can expect to receive a separate notice from PRM stating that an application has been selected before PRM actually makes the federal award. That notice is not an authorization to begin performance. Only the notice of award signed by the grants officer is the authorizing document. Unsuccessful applicants will be notified following completion of the selection and award process.
2. Administrative and National Policy Requirements. PRM awards are made consistent with the following provisions in the following order of precedence: (a) applicable laws and statutes of the United States, including any specific legislative provisions mandated in the statutory authority for the award; (b) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR); (c) Department of State Standard Terms and Conditions of the award; (d) the awardâs specific requirements; and (e) other documents and attachments to the award.
3. Reporting
Successful applicants will be required to submit:
(a) Program Reports: PRM requires program reports describing and analyzing the results of activities undertaken during the validity period of the agreement. A program report is required within thirty (30) days following the end of each three month period of performance during the validity period of the agreement. The final program report is due ninety (90) days following the end of the agreement. The submission dates for program reports will be written into the cooperative agreement. Partners receiving multi-year awards should follow this same reporting schedule and should still submit a final program report at the end of each year that summarizes the NGOâs performance during the previous year.
The Performance Progress Report  (SF-PPR) is a standard, government-wide performance reporting format. Recipients of PRM funding must submit the signed SF-PPR cover page with each program report. In addition, the Bureau suggests that NGOs receiving PRM funding use the PRM recommended program report template and reference this template as being attached in block 10 of the SF-PPR. This template is designed to ease the reporting requirements while ensuring that all required elements are addressed. The Program Report Template can be requested by sending an email with only the phrase âPRM NGO Templatesâ (without the quotation marks) in the subject line to PRMNGOCoordinator@state.gov.
(b) Financial Reports: Financial reports are required within thirty (30) days following the end of each calendar year quarter during the validity period of the agreement (January 30th, April 30th, July 30th, October 30th). The final financial report covering the entire period of the agreement is required within ninety (90) days after the expiration date of the agreement. For agreements containing indirect costs, final financial reports are due within sixty (60) days of the finalization of the applicable negotiated indirect cost rate agreement (NICRA).
Reports reflecting expenditures for the recipientâs overseas and United States offices should be completed in accordance with the Federal Financial Report (FFR SF-425) and submitted electronically in the Department of Health and Human Servicesâ Payment Management System (HHS/PMS) and in accordance with other award specific requirements. Detailed information pertaining to the Federal Financial Report including due dates, instruction manuals and access forms, is provided on the HHS/PMS website .
For more details regarding reporting requirements please see PRMâs General NGO Guidelines.
(c) Audit Reports: When a recipient-contracted audit is not required because the Federal award amount is less than the $750,000 threshold, the Department may determine that an audit must be performed and the audit report must be submitted to the responsible grants office(r) for review, dissemination, and resolution as appropriate. The cost of audits required under this policy may be charged either as an allowable direct cost to the award, or included in the organizations established indirect costs in the awardâs detailed budget.
