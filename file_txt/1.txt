Please note that PRM will hold an information session from 12:00 pm to 1:00 pm Eastern time, Thursday, April 21, specifically geared toward helping new applicants better understand the requirements.  PRM is available to answer questions and provide guidance during the application process.  For details on accessing the information session, please refer to page 19.

Full Text of Notice of Funding Opportunity
Program Description

Purpose of the Reception and Placement (R&P) Program
The R&P Program for the initial reception and placement of refugees in the United States is managed by PRM (hereinafter also referred to as the “Bureau”).  The purpose of the R&P Program is to promote the successful reception and placement of all persons who are admitted to the United States under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.  For the purpose of this announcement, “refugee” is defined as a person admitted to the United States under section 207(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as amended, or a person to whom eligibility for the resettlement assistance available to individuals admitted under section 207(c) has been extended by statute.
To accomplish this goal, the INA recognizes the desirability for public or private non-profit organizations to provide R&P services and to assist refugees to achieve economic self-sufficiency as quickly as possible. The program goals and objectives set forth in this announcement have been established in accordance with these statutory provisions.
The goals of the R&P Program administered by the Bureau are:

To ensure the ability to receive promptly into the United States all refugees approved for admission under applicable provisions of the INA;
To ensure that all refugees approved for admission to the United States are provided with reception and placement services appropriate to their personal circumstances;
To maintain national capacity for the reception and placement of refugees, in accordance with admissions ceilings determined annually by the President after consultation with the Congress; and,
To assist refugees in achieving economic self-sufficiency in coordination with other refugee services and assistance programs authorized by the INA and any mainstream services and assistance programs for which refugees are eligible.

Core program objectives for FY 2023 include the following:

Resettlement Agency management ensures sound and timely operations to appropriately prepare and plan for refugee arrivals to the United States.
Resettlement Agency management provides sound oversight and support to maintain a flexible, well-equipped, and knowledgeable affiliate network.
Resettlement Affiliates deliver timely and individualized services that promote refugee well-being, integration, and self-sufficiency.
Resettlement Affiliates regularly engage, inform, and consult resettlement partners and broader stakeholders in their communities.
Resettlement Affiliates ensure refugees are connected to appropriate services and oriented to their new communities.
Resettlement Affiliates involve local communities to provide services and increase assistance and other integration support to refugees.

The Bureau partners with and provides partial financial support to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to carry out the R&P Program.  Participating organizations are expected to combine the Bureau’s financial assistance with existing and projected private resources for the provision of R&P services for refugees admitted to the United States during the period October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023.  The R&P service period is defined as an initial 30-day period that can be extended up to 90 days after arrival should more than 30 days be required to complete delivery of R&P services.
Funding Procedures
The final FY 2023 ceiling for refugee admissions will be established by the President following consultations with Congress towards the end of FY 2022.  In order to serve the Administration’s stated goal to admit up to 125,000 refugees in FY 2023, PRM intends to award initial funding and placement plans at an operational level of 65,000 refugee arrivals.  Arrival trends will be reviewed mid-year to adjust placement plans and budgets upwards, as needed.  In addition, applicants should include 10,000 Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) recipients in their planning.
Under expected FY 2023 funding procedures, each agency with which the Bureau enters into a Cooperative Agreement (CA) will be provided a $1,225 per capita grant for direct assistance to each refugee it sponsors who arrives in the United States during the period of the CA and is verified to have been placed and assisted by the agency.  This funding is to be used to cover payments made by the affiliate to or on behalf of individual refugees for cash disbursement and/or purchases for the purpose of meeting material needs according to the requirements of the program.
PRM also expects to provide an additional $1,050 per capita for affiliate R&P administrative costs, based on planned arrivals.  This amount is intended to support the affiliate’s administrative capacity to deliver services to refugees in accordance with program requirements as described in the CA.  All administrative funding given will be based on funding availabilities.
The entirety of the per capita funding, both direct assistance and administrative, is intended to supplement private resources available to the applicant and may be used at the local affiliates at which refugees are resettled.
PRM may award additional direct assistance funding to be administered by the resettlement agency national management office throughout their network to supplement the per capita grant according to factors that may vary geographically such as cost of living, housing, and additional caseload vulnerabilities. This assistance should focus on unmet needs and not duplicate or supplant programs available under any other Federal source of funding.
The Bureau intends to fund R&P Program national management costs according to separately negotiated and approved budgets based on the applicant’s sponsorship assurance capacity.
Applicants should base their placement plans provided to PRM in response to this funding opportunity on the capacity of their network of local affiliates, which will need to have consulted with resettlement partners in their communities in order to assess the capacity of the state, local community(ies), and affiliate to ensure that sufficient capacity exists to resettle the proposed caseload.  As part of this assessment, PRM expects that, to the extent possible, applicants will communicate and coordinate closely with other resettlement agencies proposing to place refugees in the same geographic area to ensure state and local partners are well-informed and consulted regarding the combined caseload being proposed among all local affiliates.
Refugee Caseload Assignment
Cases will be assigned to each approved applicant through a process administered on behalf of the Bureau by the Refugee Processing Center (RPC).
The number of refugees assigned to an approved applicant for FY 2023 will be determined by the Bureau, in accordance with the needs of the Admissions Program, taking into account projected initial operating levels as well as the target established by the FY 2023 Presidential Determination; the proposed capacity of the applicant and its affiliates; recommendations of state and local officials and the Office of Refugee Resettlement; the applicant’s demonstrated ability to implement its proposed placement plan; the cost effectiveness of the applicant’s plan; and past performance.  The number of refugees assigned to an approved applicant may be less than the proposed placement capacity of the applicant.  Iraqi and Afghan SIV recipients requesting R&P services will be allocated to the approved applicants in the same manner as refugee cases.
In proposing placement figures for FY 2024 and FY 2025, applicants are encouraged to demonstrate how they will grow capacity over the course of three years. This approach will allow both existing and new RAs to scale up gradually.  We encourage new applicants to consider a smaller, manageable number of affiliates and initial caseload in the first year of the program while systems and structures are being established, and then scale up in a sustainable and incremental manner over the course of the following two years.
Please note, outyear projections approved as part of FY 2023 proposals are considered as informational in nature, and do not constitute a guarantee of any future approvals or arrivals.  Participants will need to propose specific capacity plans annually, based on the above-noted factors.
New Applicants
PRM welcomes proposals from new applicants, including non-profit organizations that are currently participating in the Afghan Placement and Assistance Program (APA) but have not previously participated in R&P such as institutional partner organizations that have worked with resettlement agencies through APA. In line with the above guidance, PRM encourages new applicants to submit three-year proposals that scale incrementally and sustainably over time, initially starting with a smaller caseload and then growing capacity to support larger caseloads in future years once systems and structures are fully established.  Additional detailed guidance for new applicants can be found in Appendix B.
Federal Award Information

Proposed program start date:  October 1, 2022.
Duration of Activity: An initial period beginning October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2023, subject to the availability of funds.  This agreement may be renewable for up to two additional 12-month awards based upon new budget submissions for each award on an annual basis.  Continued funding after the initial 12-month period of performance requires the submission of a noncompeting single year proposal and will be contingent upon available funding, strong performance, and continuing need.  In funding a program one year, PRM makes no representations that it will continue to fund the program in successive years.
Period of Performance:  An initial 12-month period of performance with the possibility of two additional one-year awards for a total program duration of 36 months.
Funding Limits:   The Bureau anticipates award amounts will vary based on
placement plans and overall national management and affiliate funding needs.  There is no funding floor or ceiling for this award.  However, total award amounts will be contingent on funding availabilities.
Anticipated Amount to be Awarded Total: Total amounts awarded will be based on a thorough review of each proposal received and amount of funding available in FY 2023.

IMPORTANT: Please see Appendix E for the complete list of additional documents that MUST be submitted as part of the Application Package.
IMPORTANT: All new applicants should see Appendix F for additional documents that MUST be submitted as part of their Application Package.
C. Each applicant is required to:

be registered in SAM at (www.sam.gov) before submitting an application;
provide a valid SAM.gov UEI number in its application; and
continue to maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times during which it has an active PRM award or an application or plan under consideration by PRM.

No federal award may be made to an applicant until the applicant has complied with all applicable SAM requirements and, if an applicant has not fully complied with the requirements by the time the PRM award is ready to be made, PRM may determine that the applicant is not qualified to receive a PRM award and use that determination as a basis for making a PRM award to another applicant.   Proposals must be submitted via Grants.gov (not via SAMS Domestic).
Note: On April 4, 2022, the DUNS Number was replaced by a “new, non  proprietary identifier” requested in, and assigned by, the System for Award    Management (SAM.gov).  This new identifier is being called the Unique Entity Identifier (UEI).  For more information on the process, visit   GSA’s website on the UEI transition. 
D.  Applications must be submitted via Grants.gov.  Grants.gov registration requires a UEI number and active SAM.gov registration.  If you are new to PRM funding, the Grants.gov registration process can be complicated.  We urge you to refer to PRM’s General NGO Guidelines “Application Process” section for information and resources to help ensure that the application process runs smoothly.  PRM also strongly encourages organizations that have received funding from PRM in the past to read this section as a refresher.  Applicants may also refer to the “For Applicants” page on Grants.gov for complete details on requirements.   
 Do not wait until the deadline to submit your application on Grants.gov.  Organizations not registered with Grants.gov should register well in advance of the deadline as it can take up to two weeks to finalize registration (sometimes longer for non-U.S. based NGOs to receive required registration numbers).  We also recommend that organizations, particularly first-time applicants, submit applications via Grants.gov no later than one week before the deadline to avoid last-minute technical difficulties that could result in an application not being considered.  PRM partners must maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times during which they have an active federal award or an application under consideration by PRM or any federal agency.
When registering with Grants.gov, organizations must designate points of contact and Authorized Organization Representatives (AORs).  Organizations based outside the United States must also request and receive an NCAGE  code prior to registering with SAM.gov.  Applicants experiencing technical difficulties with the SAM registration process should contact the Federal Service Desk (FSD) online or at 1-866-606-8220 (U.S.) and 1-334-206-7828 (International).
Applications must be submitted under the authority of the Authorized Organization Representative at the applicant organization.  Having proposals submitted by the agency national management office helps to avoid possible technical problems.
If you encounter technical difficulties with Grants.gov please contact the Grants.gov Help Desk at support@grants.gov or by calling 1-800-518-4726.
Applicants who are unable to submit applications via Grants.gov due to Grants.gov technical difficulties and;

who have reported the problem to the Grants.gov help desk;
received a case number; and
have completed UEI and SAM.gov registrations; 
had a service request opened to research the problem;

may contact the relevant PRM Program Officer before the submission deadline to determine whether an alternative method of submission is appropriate.
It is the responsibility of each applicant to ensure the appropriate registrations are in place and active.  Failure to have the appropriate organizational registrations in place is not considered a technical difficulty and is not justification for an alternate means of submission.
In accordance with 2 CFR §200.113, Mandatory disclosures, the non-Federal entity or applicant for a Federal award must disclose, in a timely manner, in writing to the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity all violations of Federal criminal law involving fraud, bribery, or gratuity violations potentially affecting the Federal award.  Non-Federal entities that have received a Federal award including the term and condition outlined in Appendix XII—Award Term and Condition for Recipient Integrity and Performance Matters are required to report certain civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings to SAM.  Failure to make required disclosures can result in any of the remedies described in 2 CFR §200.338 Remedies for noncompliance, including suspension or debarment.  (See also 2 CFR part 180, 31 U.S.C.  3321, and 41 U.S.C.  2313.)
E.  Submission Dates and Times

Federal Award Administration Information

 Federal Award Administration.  A successful applicant can expect to receive a separate notice from PRM stating that an application has been selected before PRM actually makes the federal award.  That notice is not an authorization to begin performance.  Only the notice of award signed by the grants officer is the authorizing document.  Unsuccessful applicants will be notified following completion of the selection and award process.
 Administrative and National Policy Requirements.  PRM awards are made consistent with the following provisions in the following order of precedence: (a) applicable laws and statutes of the United States, including any specific legislative provisions mandated in the statutory authority for the award; (b) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR); (c) Department of State Standard Terms and Conditions of the award; (d) the award’s specific requirements; and (e) other documents and attachments to the award.

Appendix A: Other Required Information
Organizations must consider the following as part of their proposal package:
A.  Project Narrative
The Project Narrative must adhere to these requirements:

The Project Narrative must be subtitled and numbered to correspond with the required information sections below.  If any individual section of information is not applicable, that fact should be specifically stated.


The narrative must not exceed 25 pages.  If applicable, include additional appendices to describe any of the following activities being proposed:

The Unaccompanied Refugee Minor (URM) program (one page)
International Organization for Migration (IOM) travel loan billing services (two pages)
Placement of refugees outside affiliates’ 100-mile same-state Radii via community partners (Remote Placement, two pages)


Note that page numbers must be sequential for the entirety of the Project Narrative and not restart with each section of required information.


Submit the Project Narrative as an attachment by selecting the “Project Narrative Attachment Form” in the Grants.gov Application Package.

The Project Narrative must contain the following sections:

Organizational Structure and Management 

Each applicant must briefly describe its organizational structure and discuss how it demonstrates cost effectiveness while maintaining strong management and program oversight.
For previous recipients, discuss how the organization is adapting and innovating, in light of the APA program, as well as other changes in the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, national management, organization, or operations.  If applicable, explain any proposed changes per position from FY 2022.  Justify the number and need for the proposed FTEs to serve the proposed number of refugees.
Describe formal or legal relationships with affiliates and sub-offices. State the number of placement sites (number of affiliates and sub-offices).  If applicable, list all affiliate and sub-office sites that were listed as zeroed out or were opened or closed in 2022, as well as proposed new sites and sites planned for closure in FY 2023.  Describe a coherent strategy and rationale for selecting and maintaining resettlement sites in the placement network.
Describe organizational plans to manage projected increases in arrivals in FY 2023 at both the national and affiliate levels. Further, explain the national management strategy to prepare at both levels for ongoing expansions in subsequent years to ensure there is sufficient capacity within each affiliate and local community, as well as sufficient local community engagement, to adequately support changing arrivals.
2.  Program Management
Applicants with existing programs must include a brief narrative description of how they actively manage resources to meet, and demonstrate accountability for, program outcomes.
Describe applicant’s initiatives at the national and local levels to collect and use beneficiary feedback to improve programming.
Describe the applicant’s strategy to ensure that refugees are able to access affordable, safe, and sanitary permanent housing upon arrival, or shortly thereafter. Include plans to ensure capacity to resettle refugees both with and without U.S. ties. Briefly summarize current activities or partnerships that address the nationwide affordable housing crisis and give specific examples of strategies from locations where challenges are particularly acute.
Describe the applicant’s community engagement strategies for FY 2023 at the national, state, and local levels. The term “community engagement” includes public education efforts, resource development, community outreach, volunteerism, quarterly consultations, and coordination with local stakeholders. Include how your strategies identify key issues and/or risk factors, how they affect successful resettlement, and how they will improve outcomes for refugees so that community services and support are available to newly arriving refugees. If applicable, discuss how activities in FY 2022, including involvement in the APA program, inform the applicant’s community engagement strategies for FY 2023 and beyond.
Describe organizational plans to ensure the safety and security of refugee resettlement staff, volunteers, and beneficiaries.
Describe a sound management strategy to onboard any new affiliates in FY 2023, along with plans to support robust community engagement and coordination.  Include a description of plans and strategies for any potential further expansion in subsequent years, if applicable.
3. Community Sponsorship
Describe applicant’s plans to increase community sponsorship of refugees, particularly through co-sponsorship programs.

Community sponsorship is an umbrella term to describe different models of resettlement whereby certain refugees are paired with community groups that commit to providing clearly defined in-kind and/or financial contributions as well as volunteer services to support the welcome and integration of refugees in a local community. These can be formed from a range of community groups such as local clubs, university communities, faith-based institutions or community groups, sports teams, book clubs, etc.
Co-sponsorship is a specific form of community sponsorship where community groups accept, in a non-legally binding written agreement with a local affiliate or community partner, the responsibility to provide, or ensure the provision of, the majority or all of R&P services in partnership with that local affiliate or community partner.  To streamline terminology on community sponsorship, PRM will be focused on increasing co-sponsorship programs going forward and will consider the activities of “support teams” to be considered as general volunteerism rather than as another form of community sponsorship.
PRM is interested in the added value to the R&P program that may be generated through community sponsorship such as improved refugee integration, increased housing and employment opportunities, and strengthened community and private support.  PRM also sees value in sponsorship for communities themselves, for maximizing refugee contributions, and for increasing public support for refugees and awareness of global affairs. PRM expects that applicants will establish clear objectives, strategies, and expected outcomes/results for community sponsorship models.

4. Fraud Prevention & Risk Analysis: 
Include a brief description of the applicant’s fraud prevention strategies and activities, including how the applicant uses culturally effective practices and procedures with refugees to combat fraud, and how the applicant responds to alleged or possible fraud (including, but not limited to, immigration and welfare benefit fraud). Please also include a brief summary of the risk analysis submitted as part of the proposal package.
5. Gender Analysis:  
PRM is committed to ensuring that R&P services are fully accessible to potentially vulnerable and underserved groups among the beneficiary population (such groups may include women; children; adolescents; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or intersex (LGBTQI+) individuals; older persons; the sick; persons with disabilities; and members of minority communities). The gender analysis should specifically analyze the factors that either promote or undermine gender equality within a given program and specifically address the needs of women and girls.
Applicants should briefly describe:

The gender dynamics within the target population (i.e., roles, power dynamics, and different needs of men and women, girls and boys),
The specific risks and challenges posed by gender dynamics to R&P Program implementation, and


How the program activities will mitigate these risks and be made accessible to affected groups (particularly women and girls).

6. Financial Contributions: 
Please input the total aggregate contributions in support of R&P to all affiliates and sub-offices (as documented in the affiliate/sub-office abstracts) in the chart below and provide a short description of the private contributions, including a breakdown of whether contributions were used to support R&P direct assistance or affiliate R&P program management.

Describe criteria used to determine placement of refugees throughout a network which prioritizes quality, language-appropriate R&P services for arriving refugees of diverse backgrounds, and which positions them to succeed and integrate in the United States.  Identify the indicators used to evaluate other key placement factors such as community support and the best interest of the refugee. Include specific reference to evidence-based research that informs your placement strategies and mechanisms and detail how they guide and impact placement.
If applicable, explain where significant increases or decreases in placement are expected in FY 2023. Please describe strategies for growing placement capacity in following years.  Describe the applicant’s efforts to respond to variable arrival patterns while ensuring the required level of service to all refugees.  Describe how the state refugee coordinator, state refugee health coordinator, and other local service providers are consulted in the placement planning process and strategy.
8. Network Monitoring 
Applicants should describe monitoring of affiliates and sub-offices, and community partners if applicable, to include number of staff, duration of trips, and cost effectiveness.  If desk monitoring is used, describe the circumstances and process.  Explain the applicant’s process and timeframes for ensuring that corrective actions taken (in response to PRM monitoring, agency monitoring, and beneficiary feedback) result in final program compliance.
9. Network Training
Describe the overall network training strategy and how proposed activities will strengthen R&P service delivery.  Include the purpose of each training activity, its frequency, desired outcomes, and mechanisms for ensuring appropriate staff receive the training, and how training effectiveness will be measured.  Applicants should specify how monitoring trends will impact training plans.  Justify the cost effectiveness of the training mode being employed, i.e., conferences, distance learning, webinars.  Clearly establish the need for any proposed in-person trainings or conferences versus other modes of training.
Applicants with existing programs should list network training activities related to R&P that took place, or are expected to take place, in FY 2022.  Note the number of staff who attended each training (distinguish between national management and affiliate staff) and explain how the effectiveness of the training was measured.
10. Placement of Refugees Outside Affiliates’ Radii — Remote Placement, if applicable (additional 2 page maximum)
Cases may be placed outside an affiliate’s 100-mile, same state radius via remote placement community partners. Applicants proposing to make use of remote placement community partners should provide their strategy and rationale, particularly for the placement of cases without U.S. ties.  The overall implementation and management of this model should also be detailed.
Include national management structure, staffing, and resources proposed to oversee the process within the R&P program infrastructure (both pre- and post-arrival), as well as a detailed timeline for implementation.  Describe the strategy for identifying, training, and onboarding community partners, as well as for consulting and coordinating with state and local stakeholders during and after this process.  In the HQ staffing chart, budget narrative, and budget, clearly identify any staffing and costs related to this placement model.  Include the proposed placement capacity.
11.  Unaccompanied Refugee Minor (URM) Foster Care Program Applicants, if applicable (additional 1 page maximum)
If an applicant is currently participating in the placement of unaccompanied refugee minors into foster care and wishes to continue these placements in FY 2023 and subsequent years, the proposal should describe national management procedures for placing and assuring such cases during FY 2022 and list participating affiliates.  List all proposed new URM sites. Applicants should also provide URM Affiliate Abstracts for each foster care site and include such sites in their consolidated placement plan.
IMPORTANT: All new applicants should refer to Appendix B.
12.  IOM Travel Loan Program, if applicable
(additional 2 page maximum)
For applicable current R&P Program participants, applicant should describe how its system for administering refugee transportation loans enables it to comply with the responsibilities set forth in the CA and those set forth in the separate Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with IOM.  The description should address each of the CA and IOM MOU responsibilities and how each one is met or not met by the system.  Should a responsibility not yet be met by the loan system, please provide specific information on proposed changes and when such changes will be implemented to fully meet the requirements.  For example, does the system include appropriate procedures to successfully trace addresses?  Are social security numbers recorded in the loan files?  Does the system interface with the IOM Loan Tracking System (LTS) for the importing of USRAP Travel Loan Promissory Note (ePN) data and the exporting of Account Balances, Transactions and Transfers to IOM?  Are loan notes transferred to IOM in accordance with the steps set forth in the IOM MOU?  Are management procedures in place to ensure compliance with applicable federal, state and municipal statutes and regulations governing billing services?  Detail the number of full- and part-time staff devoted to the IOM travel loan effort during the current year and the number expected to be devoted under a new agreement.
Note: Only applicants approved for participation may be assigned IOM travel loans; should new R&P agencies be identified and funded as a result of this announcement, they should not assume that their future number of assigned refugees will be sufficient to operate an individual loan program.
IMPORTANT: All new applicants should refer to Appendix B.
B.  Objectives and Indicators Table
Applicants must submit a table detailing proposed objectives and indicators for FY 2023 – FY 2025.  Tables should include the core program objectives and indicators as included in the sample format provided on Grants.gov.  Though not required, applicants are encouraged to include additional indicators that reflect the way in which their organization measures and evaluates achievement of R&P program goals and objectives.  Proposed objectives and indicators should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and reliable, time-bound, and trackable (SMART), and should be clearly linked to the program goals highlighted in Section A.1 of this notice of funding opportunity.  Note that these objectives and indicators will inform ongoing Bureau evaluation of agency performance, including via quarterly program reports and annual monitoring of the agency national management office.
C. FY 2023-2025 R&P Budget
The R&P Program represents a long-standing public-private partnership and is funded from a combination of public and private resources.  If applicable, applicants should document contributions of private resources to the R&P Program at the national management and affiliate levels.  Applicants should provide a detailed and cost-effective budget.  The Budget must contain the following sections (on separate tabs) and should adhere to the requirements listed:

FY 2023-2025 R&P Budget Summary


FY 2023-2025 National Management Budget Detail


FY 2023-2025 Travel Cost Detail

A sample excel format for the R&P Budget Summary, National Management Budget Detail, and Travel Cost Detail is provided on Grants.gov. The sample format for the R&P National Management Budget Summary and Detail includes columns reflecting the Bureau (federal) and other (non-federal) funding sources as well as the total funding need.  These budget documents require each applicant to provide a breakdown of sources and amounts of non-federal funding supporting the national management and affiliate levels in the R&P program. The affiliate abstracts include a similar breakdown of sources and amounts of non-federal funding supporting R&P at the affiliate level.  These breakdowns should correspond to the amounts of non-federal funding included in the project narrative (for affiliate-level non-federal funding).  The Travel Cost Detail requires a breakdown of the associated costs for each planned trip by travel category.  The R&P National Management Budget Summary and Detail, and Travel Cost Detail should follow the instructions listed in Appendix A.  The applicant shall comply with the relevant provisions of 2 CFR 200, “Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards” and the Department of State Standard Terms and Conditions.
Please include resources and staff position(s) in your National Management Budget that would bolster capacity for your network to file Affidavit of Relationships (AORs) for the Central American Minor (CAM) Program, Ukrainians, and other P-3 family reunification cases.  These positions could be remote and operated by national staff, roving, or assigned to affiliate locations where there are a large number of Ukrainians, Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Hondurans, and other P-3 caseloads.  You may also propose providing sub-grant(s) to local organizations who will assist with outreach and AOR filing.
Please include resources and staff position(s) in your National Management Budget to support the development of new local affiliates, as applicable.
D.  FY 2023-2025 National Management Budget Narrative
The National Management Budget Narrative should be a separate, narrative document, and must describe in full detail each of the items included in the FY 2023-2025 R&P Budget Summary, National Management Budget Detail, and Travel Cost Detail.  The Budget Narrative should thoroughly and clearly describe each item and how figures were calculated; correspond with the information, comments, and figures provided on the R&P Budget Summary and National Management Budget Detail; be easy to understand; demonstrate cost effectiveness; and reflect calculations that are mathematically correct and comply with guidelines and limitations.  For existing applicants, any changes to the prior year’s budget should be clearly noted and explained.  Note that page numbers should be sequential for the entirety of the Budget Narrative and separate from the project narrative pagination.  For more information on the cost categories that should be included in the National Management Budget Narrative, please reference Appendix A.
HQ Administered Additional Direct Assistance Funds:  
In addition to the per capita grant, PRM may make available additional direct assistance funds to be administered by the resettlement agency national management office.  These funds would be awarded along with refugee per capita grants, to align with expected arrivals.  Funding amounts may be awarded at a per capita rate to be determined and must be used for refugees within their R&P period.  Applicants should describe how any additional direct assistance R&P funds would be distributed to affiliates in their network to supplement the per capita grant according to factors that may vary geographically such as cost of living, housing, and additional caseload vulnerabilities.  Proposals should discuss how the applicant would determine which affiliates are eligible to receive such additional funding and should describe their strategy to administer these additional direct assistance funds throughout their network.
You may also include any necessary subsections here that detail this strategy and policy.

K.  Supporting Documentation for New Affiliates and Sub-offices, if applicable 
All applicants must provide a statement of rationale for each proposed new affiliate or sub-office.  The rationale should discuss the need for resettlement capacity in the proposed location, the factors considered in selecting the location, and provide evidence of strong community support, particularly from required quarterly consultation participants.  Prior to proposing a new affiliate or sub-office, applicants must consult with potential partners in the proposed new site, as detailed in the abstract template.  The rationale should document any community consultations beyond the required minimum detailed in the abstract, including what topics were discussed, who was consulted, when meetings were held, and the outcome of the discussions.   The rationale should be accompanied by:

a completed abstract,


a letter of support from the proposed affiliate’s or sub-office’s governing entity, i.e., board of directors,
a letter of support from the state refugee coordinator,
letters of support from quarterly consultation participants (optional),
an explanation of the proposed management structure at the new affiliate or sub-office,
a timeline for the opening of the proposed office and implementation of program activities, and

Appendix D:  Budget Guidance
The following provides guidance for the preparation of the R&P Budget Summary, National Management Budget Detail, and National Management Budget Narrative submission using the sample Excel templates attached to this funding opportunity on Grants.gov.
Note that in the sample budget Excel templates some basic program information (number of refugees and R&P affiliates) is requested in addition to the summary budget figures.  National management budget information is required by quarter; applicants should provide real quarterly budgets, factoring in special events such as conferences or training.  Estimates should be rounded to the nearest dollar.  Clarification should be provided in the budget narrative regarding any items that may be unclear and require explanation.
Applicants with current R&P Cooperative Agreements with the Bureau should include the FY 2022 approved budget figures per line item for national management costs and provide a rationale in the budget narrative supporting the difference between FY 2022 estimated budgets and FY 2023 proposed amounts.
All budgeted costs should be directly attributable to the R&P Program.
Personnel 
This section of the budget should list individuals whose responsibility it is to oversee the provision of authorized R&P material needs support and core services.  Costs should include salaries of full-time and part-time program staff and administrative personnel associated with supervising the provision of R&P material needs support and core services.  Provide salary and Full-time Equivalent (FTE) for each individual.
If an employee works 100% of the time on the R&P Program, that employee should be listed as 1.0 FTE.  If an employee works less than 100% of the time on the R&P Program, the FTE and funding level for the employee should be prorated appropriately.  Applicants are reminded that any employee charged directly to the R&P Program must complete time sheets demonstrating that the claimed amount of time was actually devoted to working on the R&P Program versus other responsibilities.
If your organization anticipates the payment of employee termination and/or severance pay during the proposed funding period, the Bureau will consider such costs an allowable charge to the agreement to the extent of the Bureau’s responsibility in accordance with each employee’s direct relation to the Bureau’s funded activities.  For example, an employee charged to Bureau activities for one-half of their employment with the organization shall have only one half of their termination or severance costs charged to the agreement.  Explain anticipated termination or severance expenses in the budget narrative section.
Information on Cost of Living Allowances (COLA) and proposed salary increase or adjustment should be noted in the budget narrative accompanying the budget worksheet.
Fringe Benefits
This section of the budget should include benefits for full-time and part-time program staff and administrative personnel associated with supervising the provision of R&P material needs support and core services.  If the fringe benefit rate is not included in the Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement (NICRA), please provide include the rates as a percentage, consistent with the organization’s established personnel policies and practices, that are being charged per category of benefits.
Fringe benefits should be provided as a separate line item from personnel costs, representing total cost for all R&P staff listed.  Personnel whose costs are included in an applicant’s overhead base may not be included here.
Travel
This section of the budget should include travel costs related to the R&P Program for the purposes of, for example, attending allocations meetings, travel to affiliate offices to conduct R&P monitoring or training, travel to locations for new site development, attending the applicant’s national R&P conferences, and relevant Bureau meetings.  Relevant Bureau meetings are convened by the Bureau, and may include but are not limited to, R&P Program meetings, and various working groups.  Estimate no more than 20 relevant Bureau meetings.  Travel costs for applicant advisory committee meetings and/or RCUSA meetings may not be included.  No international travel costs may be included in this budget.  There are three areas in the budget worksheets to include travel details:  1) Provide a brief description of the travel in the comments section of the budget detail worksheet (for example, number of trips for what purpose at a cost of $xx per trip); 2) In the budget narrative, include purpose of trip, departure and arrival cities, duration, number of travelers, and total cost by travel category and overall travel costs; and 3) include the following information for each trip as a separate attachment (as suggested in the sample Travel Cost spreadsheet):  Departure city, arrival city, duration, number of travelers, total airfare cost, total lodging cost, total M&E per diem, other costs, and total cost.
Equipment
Provide separate estimates for expendable and non-expendable equipment and furnishings, with explanation in the comments section.  Non-expendable equipment is that which has a useful life of one year or more and an acquisition cost of $5,000 or more per unit.
Supplies
Supplies would include, but are not limited to, stationery, copier paper, envelopes, paper clips, pens, pencils, file folders, or other small items generally used within one (1) year or less.
Contractual
Provide and delineate contractual costs and professional fees according to appropriate category (e.g., computer consultant, program consultants, services of certified public accountants, etc. whose work is directly related to R&P).  Applicants are reminded that contracts not dedicated entirely to the R&P Program may not be charged to the program.
Construction
Generally, the Bureau limits the use of Federal assistance awards to implement new construction programs and programs involving significant construction activities consistent with Department-wide policy.  An applicant may, however, request consideration of minor construction related activities that consist of the renovation or rehabilitation of existing permanent structures with a sufficient description of the activities and/or related statements of work to be performed.  The construction, renovation, or rehabilitation of temporary structures should be excluded from this section.
Other Direct Costs 
This section of the budget should include costs directly attributable to the R&P Program not covered by any of the previous categories.  Such costs must be individually itemized and explained.  Some examples of costs that might appear in this section include subscriptions, briefing and orientation materials, conference registrations, rental or lease of office space, telephone service, postage and courier service, electricity, heat, water, and custodial and maintenance service.
Total Indirect Costs
This section should show the amount of indirect costs and the base amount on which it is determined.  A copy of the current NICRA must be submitted for recipient and sub-recipient(s) as applicable.  Inclusion of indirect costs must be in compliance with the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, (OMB Circular 2 CFR Part 200).
Applicants are reminded that national management costs not dedicated entirely to the R&P Program may not be charged to the program.  Applicants should also articulate this indirect cost breakdown in the National Management Budget Narrative
