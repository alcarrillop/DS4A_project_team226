Full Text of Notice of Funding Opportunity
1. Program Description
ThisÂ announcement is designed to accompanyÂ PRMâsÂ General NGO GuidelinesÂ which contain additional information on PRMâs priorities and NGO funding strategy with which selected organizations must comply.Â Â Please use both theÂ General NGO GuidelinesÂ and this announcement to ensure that your submission is in full compliance with PRM requirements and that the proposed activities are in line with PRMâs priorities.Â Â Submissions that do not reflect the requirements outlined in these guidelines will not be considered.
A. Current Funding Priorities: Proposed activities should support refugee populations and host communities in Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Niger, and refugee returnee populations in Senegal. Because of PRM’s mandate to provide protection, assistance, and sustainable solutions for refugees and victims of conflict, PRM will consider funding only those programs that include a target beneficiary base of at least 50 percent refugees in Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Niger or refugee returnees in Senegal, and in the sectors outlined in the country-specific guidelines below. Programs in non-camp areas should pursue a community-based approach that also benefits host communities. It is strongly encouraged that projects mainstream protection, in particular gender-based violence (GBV) risk mitigation, across proposed sectors and activities. Proposals may include host government capacity building as an aspect that supports other refugee assistance/protection activities. PRM strongly recommends submitting multiyear proposals for multiyear activities that build on previous year activities.
B. Program area:Â Â Proposals must support one or more of the following program areas:
Burkina Faso: Proposed activities must support Malian refugees living in Goudebou and Mentao camps or settled outside of camps. Proposals may focus on one or more of the following areas of intervention:

Protection, including child protection, gender-based violence (GBV) prevention and response, and support for vulnerable groups
Livelihoods â priority will be given to programs that foster refugeesâ economic security/self-sufficiency (must include a market analysis, or will be disqualified)
Education

Mauritania: Proposed activities must support Malian refugees (living in Mbera camp or outside of camp in Bassikounou Department. Proposals may focus on one or more of the following areas of intervention:

Protection, including child protection, gender-based violence (GBV) prevention and response
Education â priority will be given to projects that demonstrate coordination with national education plans of both the host country and â when possible â the country of origin

Niger: It is strongly recommended that organizations wishing to work with both Malian and Nigerian refugees in Niger submit a single proposal that covers activities benefiting both populations. Organizations are not required to work with both Malian and Nigerian refugees. Proposed activities must focus primarily on support for Malian refugees in Tillabery or Tahoua regions, and/or support for Nigerian refugees and other conflict-victims in Diffa region. PRM is not currently funding NGO programs in Maradi Region. Proposals may focus on one or more of the following areas of intervention:

For Malian refugees living in camps, zones d’accueil, or those who have transitioned or are in the process of transitioning out of camps as part of UNHCR âlocalizationâ efforts. Proposals may focus on one or more of the following areas of intervention:
(i) Protection, including child protection and gender-based violence (GBV) prevention and response, and support for vulnerable groups
(ii) Livelihoods â priority will be given to programs that foster refugeesâ economic security/self-sufficiency (must include a market analysis, or will be disqualified)


For Nigerian refugees and other conflict-victims in the Diffa region living in current or planned refugee camps or outside of camps. Priority will be given to programs that can also demonstrate benefit to affected host communities and/or Nigerien returnees displaced by the conflict in Nigeria. Proposals may focus on one or more of the following areas of intervention:
(i) Protection, including child protection, gender-based violence (GBV) prevention and response, and support for vulnerable groups â priority will be given to assistance for unaccompanied and separated minors, women and girls, and/or prevention of recruitment by armed groups and ensuring civilian character of refugee-hosting sites

5. Application and Submission Instructions
Consortia: Organizations may apply to this call as part of a consortia; however, for consortia, one organization must be designated as the lead applicant. For purposes of consortia applying for PRM funding, PRMâs considers consortium to be a group of no less than three NGOs that comprise an agreement, combination, or group formed to undertake, or propose to undertake, an assistance activity beyond the resources of any one member.
Submissions by organizations as part of a consortium do not count toward an individual organizationâs submission limit.Â  A description of how the partnership will be organized and how lines of authority and decision-making will be managed across all team members and between the lead applicant and associate awardees should be included in the proposal.
Content and Form of Application: Organizations may submit a maximum of 1 proposal(s) per country only.Â  Any subsequent submissions received will be disqualified.Â  PRM strongly recommends using the proposal and budget templates that are available upon email request from PRM’s NGO Coordinator.Â  Organizations can request single-year and multi-year funding proposal narrative templates by emailing PRM’s NGO Coordinator with the subject line âPRM NGO Templatesâ (exactly as written, without the quotation marks), and you will get automatic reply email with all of the templates.
Single-Year Proposals:
Single-year program proposal page limits: Single-year proposals using PRMâs templates must be no more than 15 pages in length (Times New Roman 12 point font, one inch margins on all sides).Â  If the applicant does not use PRMâs recommended templates, proposals must not exceed 10 pages in length.Â  Organizations may choose to attach work plans, activity calendars, and/or logical frameworks as addendums/appendices to the proposal.Â  These attachments do not count toward the page limit total; however, annexes cannot be relied upon as a key source of program information.Â  The proposal narrative must be able to stand on its own in the application process.Â  For multi-year funding application instructions, see section (e) below.Â  Proposals exceeding the page limit will not be considered.

PRM recommends proposals be submitted in Adobe PDF, as Microsoft Word documents may sometimes produce different page lengths based on software versions and configurations.
Exceeding page length limits, including through the inclusion of cover pages, will result in disqualification.
All proposals, and required documents, must be in English.

Multi-Year Proposals:

Applicants proposing multi-year programs should adhere to the following guidance: Applicants may submit proposals that include multi-year strategies presented in one year (12 month) cycles for a period not to exceed three years (36 months) from the proposed start date. Fully developed programs with detailed budgets, objectives and indicators are required for each year of activities.Â  Applicants should use PRMâs recommended multi-year proposal template for the first year of a multi-year application.
Multi-year funding applicants may use PRMâs budget summary and separate budget detail templates, and should disaggregate budget by year, per year, and for each program year. Multi-year proposal narratives and budgets can be updated yearly upon submission of new noncompeting single year proposal narrative template with an updated budget, each year.
Multi-year program proposal page limits: Multi-year proposals using PRMâs multi-year template must be no more than 20 pages in length (Times New Roman 12 point font, one inch margins on all sides).Â  If the applicant does not use PRMâs recommended templates, proposals must not exceed 15 pages in length.Â  Organizations may choose to attach work plans, activity calendars, and/or logical frameworks as addendums/appendices to the proposal.Â  These attachments do not count toward the page limit total however annexes cannot be relied upon as a key source of program information.Â  The proposal narrative must be able to stand on its own in the application process.Â  Proposals exceeding the page limit will not be considered.
PRM recommends proposals be submitted in Adobe PDF, as Microsoft Word documents may sometimes produce different page lengths based on software versions and configurations.
Exceeding page length limits, including through the inclusion of cover pages, will result in disqualification.
All proposals, and required documents, must be in English.
Multi-year applications selected for funding by PRM will be funded in one year (12- month) increments based on the proposal submitted in the initial application as approved by PRM. Continued funding after the initial 12-month award requires the submission of a noncompeting single-year proposal narrative and will be contingent upon available funding, strong performance, and continuing need.Â  Follow-on applications are submitted annually for years two through three of proposals through non-competed directed announcements for the continuation funding.Â  It is strongly recommended that NGOs submit as early as possible after the directed announcement for continuation funding has been issued.Â  Years two through three of proposals must be submitted by the organization no later than 90 days before the proposed start date of the new cooperative agreement (e.g., if the next program period is to begin on September 1, submit your application by June 1).Â  Late submissions will jeopardize continued funding.
In the proposal narrative, please include an explanation of why multi-year funding may be necessary for this program to succeed, how longer periods of consultation with beneficiary populations will inform programming and enable interventions to be studied and improved, and how the proposed activities in year one will contribute to outcomes and impacts in years two and three. Please, articulate and quantify cost efficiencies that could not otherwise be attained through single year programs as well.

For Both Single and Multi-year proposals
To be considered for PRM funding, organizations must submit a complete application package, including:

Proposal narrative including objectives and indicators for each year of the program period, not exceeding the page limits above. PRM now requires a specific outcome indicator to be included each proposal.Â  Please see NGO Guidelines for more details.
Budget summary disaggregated by year and for each year of the program period.
Budget detail disaggregated by year and for each year of the program period. Organizations can request both budget summary and separate budget detail templates by emailing PRM’s NGO Coordinator with the with the subject line âPRM NGO Templatesâ (exactly as written, and without the quotation marks), and you will get automatic reply email that includes both templates.
Budget narrative disaggregated by year and for each year of the program period.
Completed SF-424, SF-424A, and SF-424B forms. PRM requires that Box 21 of the SF-424 be checked.Â Form SF-424B is now required only for those applicants who have not registered in SAM.gov or recertified their registration in SAM.gov since February 2, 2019 and completed the online representations and certifications.
Information in support of any cost-sharing/cost-matching arrangements, if applicable.
Information detailing the source of any in-kind contributions, if applicable.
Details on any sub-agreements associated with the program including the budget detail (must be part of the budget submission as noted above), if applicable.
Risk Analysis (separate from proposal narrative and from the security plan).
Organizational Chart for award applicant and sub-recipient(s), if applicable.
Key Personnel for award applicant and sub-recipient(s), if applicable.Â Applicants must furnish names, titles, and brief biographical information on the education and experience of key personnel in implementing the program and key supervisory personnel; (i.e., the members of the professional staff in a program supervisory position engaged for or assigned to duties under the award). RÃ©sumÃ©s of key personnel must be provided in an annex (or provided for approval prior to hiring).
Copy of the organizationâs Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (PSEA) Code of Conduct, will be required prior to the issuance of an award, if proposal is chosen for implementation. Please ensure that your organization has a PSEA Code of Conduct consistent with the 6 IASC Principles when you are considering competing for PRM funding or it may risk delay in finalizing the cooperative agreement (See Appendix B, section A.B.6 in the NGO Guidelines for more details).
Copy of the organizationâs Security Plan.
Copy of the organizationâs Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) framework, which organizations that have not received PRM-funding since 2016 or after must be submit separately.Â The AAP section of a NOFO proposal narrative is specific to the program being proposed, and is distinct from the organization-level AAP framework requirement listed here, which is a separate document, which organizations that have not received PRM-funding since 2016 or after must be submit separately.

Additionally, organizations must submit the following documents as part of their proposal package, if applicable:

A market analysis and a beneficiary competency/capacity assessment for all proposals that include at least one livelihoods sector objective (or will be disqualified). Please see the General NGO Guidelines for more details.
Most recent Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement (NICRA), if applicable, or a de minimis rate calculation of Modified Total Direct Costs (MTDC) if the applicant is eligible and elects to use the de minimis rate.
Most recent external audit report is required prior to issuance of an award, if proposal is chosen for implementation.
In order to be considered a competitive proposal, the proposal narrative and budget detail should include the following information:


Focus on outcome or impact indicators as much as possible. At a minimum, each objective should have one outcome or impact indicator.Â  Wherever possible, baselines should be established before the start of the program.
PRM requires a specific outcome indicator be included in each proposal measuring the sense of safety and well-being of beneficiaries. Baseline and end of program surveys should be used to measure the indicator.Â  Please see the NGO Guidelines for more details.
Include specific information on locations of programs and beneficiaries (GPS coordinates if possible) to increase PRMâs ability to track the impact of PRM funding.
Outline how the NGO will acknowledge PRM funding. If an organization believes that publicly acknowledging the receipt of USG funding for a particular PRM-funded program could potentially endanger the lives of the beneficiaries and/or the organization staff, invite suspicion about the organization’s motives, or alienate the organization from the population it is trying to help, it must provide a brief explanation in its proposal as to why it should be exempted from this requirement.
PRM expects each proposal, regardless of sector, to demonstrate protection mainstreaming, including by identifying potential protection risks associated with the program and how they will be mitigated. Assistance activities should mainstream protection by analyzing the protection risks in relation to each specific programming sector.Â  An analysis of the risks should inform how assistance is designed to minimize them and maximize protection of beneficiaries.Â  Applicants may introduce gender-specific risks in this section but provide a full analysis in the gender analysis.
PRM partners must complete a gender analysis in the proposal narrative that briefly explains (1) experiences of men, women, boys, and girls with a focus on the different familial roles, community privileges, and gender dynamics within the target population; (2) associated risks and threats experienced by women, girls, and other vulnerable populations based on their gender; (3) power imbalances and needs that arise based on gender inequalities that exist within the family or community; and (4) proposed responses that will address the above and mitigate any gender differences in access, participation, or decision-making that may be experienced by at-risk groups, particularly women and girls. The gender analysis should aim to specify and target specific at-risk sub-populations of women and girls, such as women and girl heads of households, out-of-school girls, women and girls with disabilities, women and girl survivors of violence, married girls, adolescent mothers, as well as people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or intersex (LGBTI), and those who are often unaware of and excluded from programs and services and who may be the hardest to reach based on their gender.
The budget should include a specific breakdown of funds being provided by UNHCR, other USG agencies, other donors, and your own organization.
Applicants whose proposals address gender-based violence (GBV) through their programs must estimate the total cost of these activities as a separate line item in their proposed budgets (see PRMâs budget template). Proposals and budgets must include details of any sub-agreements associated with the programs.
For consortia only, a description of how the partnership will be organized and how lines of authority and decision-making will be managed across all team members and between the lead applicant and associate awardees should be included in the proposal.

Dun and Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) Number and System for Award Management (SAM)
Each applicant is required to:

be registered in SAM at (sam.gov ) before submitting its application;
provide a valid DUNS number in its application; and
continue to maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times during which it has an active PRM award or an application or plan under consideration by PRM. No federal award may be made to an applicant until the applicant has complied with all applicable DUNS and SAM requirements and, if an applicant has not fully complied with the requirements by the time the PRM award is ready to be made, PRM may determine that the applicant is not qualified to receive a PRM award and use that determination as a basis for making a PRM award to another applicant.

Proposals must be submitted via Grants.gov (not via SAMS Domestic). gov registration requires a DUNS number and active SAM.gov registration.Â  If you are new to PRM funding, the Grants.gov registration process can be complicated.Â  We urge you to refer to PRMâs General NGO Guidelines âApplication Processâ section for information and resources to help ensure that the application process runs smoothly.Â  PRM also strongly encourages organizations that have received funding from PRM in the past to read this section as a refresher.Â  Applicants may also refer to the âFor Applicants â page on Grants.gov for complete details on requirements.
Do not wait until the deadline to submit your application on Grants.gov. Organizations not registered with Grants.gov should register well in advance of the deadline as it can take up to two weeks to finalize registration (sometimes longer for non-U.S. based NGOs to receive required registration numbers).Â  We also recommend that organizations, particularly first-time applicants, submit applications via Grants.gov no later than one week before the deadline to avoid last-minute technical difficulties that could result in an application not being considered.Â  PRM partners must maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times during which they have an active federal award or an application under consideration by PRM or any federal agency.
When registering with Grants.gov , organizations must designate points of contact and Authorized Organization Representatives (AORs). Organizations based outside the United States must also request and receive an NCAGE  (https://eportal.nspa.nato.int/AC135Public/scage/CageList.aspx ) code prior to registering with SAM.gov .Â  Applicants experiencing technical difficulties with the SAM registration process should contact the Federal Service Desk  (FSD) online or at 1-866-606-8220 (U.S.) and 1-334-206-7828 (International).

Applications must be submitted under the authority of the Authorized Organization Representative at the applicant organization. Having proposals submitted by agency headquarters helps to avoid possible technical problems.

If you encounter technical difficulties with Grants.gov please contact the Grants.gov Help Desk at support@grants.gov or by calling 1-800-518-4726.
Applicants who are unable to submit applications via Grants.gov due to Grants.gov technical difficulties and;

who have reported the problem to the Grants.gov help desk;
received a case number;
had a service request opened to research the problem;

may contact the relevant PRM Program Officer before the submission deadline to determine whether an alternative method of submission is appropriate.
It is the responsibility of each applicant to ensure the appropriate registrations are in place and active. Failure to have the appropriate organizational registrations in place is not considered a technical difficulty and is not justification for an alternate means of submission.
In accordance with 2 CFR Â§200.113, Mandatory disclosures, the non-Federal entity or applicant for a Federal award must disclose, in a timely manner, in writing to the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity all violations of Federal criminal law involving fraud, bribery, or gratuity violations potentially affecting the Federal award. Non-Federal entities that have received a Federal award including the term and condition outlined in Appendix XIIâAward Term and Condition for Recipient Integrity and Performance Matters are required to report certain civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings to SAM.Â  Failure to make required disclosures can result in any of the remedies described in 2 CFR Â§200.338 Remedies for noncompliance, including suspension or debarment.Â  (See also 2 CFR part 180, 31 U.S.C.Â  3321, and 41 U.S.C.Â  )
Submission Dates and Times

Announcement issuance date: Friday, April 17, 2020
Proposal submission deadline: Monday, May 18, 2020 at 11:59:59 p.m. Proposals submitted after this deadline will not be considered.

Other Submission Requirements
Branding and Marking Strategy
The following provisions will be included whenever assistance is awarded:
The Recipient shall recognize the United States Governmentâs funding for activities specified under this award at the project site with a graphic of the U.S. flag accompanied by one of the following two phrases based on the level of funding for the award:

Fully funded by the award: âGift of the United States Governmentâ
Partially funded by the award: âFunding provided by the United States Governmentâ

PRM highly encourages recognition of U.S. government funding on social media and website platforms to be included in proposals branding and marking strategy.Â  Recipients should tag PRMâs Twitter account @StatePRM and/or Facebook account @State.PRM (rather than using hashtags).Â  Additionally, the applicable U.S. Embassy should be tagged as well.
Updates of actions taken to fulfill this requirement must be included in quarterly program reports to PRM.
All programs, projects, assistance, activities, and public communications to foreign audiences, partially or fully funded by the Department, should be marked appropriately overseas with the standard U.S. flag in a size and prominence equal to (or greater than) any other logo or identity.Â  The requirement does not apply to the Recipientâs own corporate communications or in the United States.
The Recipient should ensure that all publicity and promotional materials underscore the sponsorship by or partnership with the U.S. Government or the U.S. Embassy.Â  The Recipient may continue to use existing logos or project materials; however, a standard rectangular U.S. flag must be used in conjunction with such logos.
Do not use the Department of State seal without the express written approval from PRM.
Sub non-Federal entities (sub-awardees) and subsequent tier sub-award agreements are subject to the marking requirements and the non-Federal entity shall include a provision in the sub non-Federal entity agreement indicating that the standard, rectangular U.S. flag is a requirement.
Exemptions from this requirement may be allowable but must be agreed to in writing by the Grants Officer.Â  (Note: An exemption refers to the complete or partial cessation of branding, not use of alternative branding).Â  Requests should be initiated with the Grants Officer and Grants Officer Representative.Â  Waivers issued are applied only to the exemptions requested through the Recipientâs proposal for funding and any subsequent negotiated revisions.
In the event the non-Federal entity does not comply with the marking requirements as established in the approved assistance agreement, the Grants Officer Representative and the Grants Officer must initiate corrective action with the non-Federal entity.
PRM Standardized Indicators: In an effort to streamline the proposal writing/reviewing process and better measure the impact of the Bureauâs work, PRM strongly recommends the use of standardized indicators for programs in the protection, child protection, health, mental health and psychosocial support, WASH, nutrition and food security, education, livelihoods, and shelter sectors, as well as programs that include local government capacity-building and core relief items (non-food items).Â  Applicants must fill in numerical and/or percentage targets for each indicator.Â  Sphere standards should be used as targets, unless otherwise noted.Â  Proposals must include at least one standardized indicator per sector, as applicable.Â  Please refer to PRMâs General NGO Guidelines for a complete list of all standardized indicators that may be included.
PRM requires a specific outcome indicator in each proposal measuring the sense of safety and well-being of beneficiaries. All overseas assistance program proposals must include the following protection outcome indicator under one of the objectives: Percentage of beneficiaries who report an improved sense of safety and well-being at the end of the program disaggregated by age and gender.Â  Please see the NGO Guidelineâs section A.C.1.Â  of Appendix C for more details.
Cash and Voucher Assistance programs must include one indicator from the selection contained in the NGO Guidelines in section A.C.2. of Appendix C.
Recipient Vetting After Award:Â  Recipients shall advise the Grants Officer of any changes in personnel listed in the DS Form 4184, Risk Analysis Information, and shall provide vetting information on new individuals.Â  The government reserves the right to vet these personnel changes and to terminate assistance awards for convenience based on vetting results.

Budget/Budget Narrative (15 points)

PRM will conduct a formal competitive review of all proposals submitted in response to this funding announcement.Â  A review panel of at least three people will evaluate submissions based on the above-referenced programmatic criteria and PRM priorities in the context of available funding.Â  Examples of PRM scorecards can be found in Appendix H of the NGO Guidelines.
Department of State review panels may provide conditions and recommendations on applications to enhance the proposed program, which must be addressed by the applicant before further consideration of the award.Â  To ensure effective use of limited PRM funds, conditions or recommendations may include requests to increase, decrease, clarify, and/or justify costs and program activities.
7. Federal Award Administration Information
Federal Award Administration. A successful applicant can expect to receive a separate notice from PRM stating that an application has been selected before PRM actually makes the federal award.Â  That notice is not an authorization to begin performance.Â  Only the notice of award signed by the grants officer is the authorizing document.Â  Unsuccessful applicants will be notified following completion of the selection and award process.
Administrative and National Policy Requirements. PRM awards are made consistent with the following provisions in the following order of precedence:Â  (a) applicable laws and statutes of the United States, including any specific legislative provisions mandated in the statutory authority for the award; (b) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR); (c) Department of State Standard Terms and Conditions of the award; (d) the awardâs specific requirements; and (e) other documents and attachments to the award.
Reporting: Successful applicants will be required to submit:

Program Reports: PRM requires program reports describing and analyzing the results of activities undertaken during the validity period of the agreement.Â  A program report is required within thirty (30) days following the end of each three month period of performance during the validity period of the agreement.Â  The final program report is due ninety (90) days following the end of the agreement.Â  The submission dates for program reports will be written into the cooperative agreement.Â  Partners receiving multi-year awards should follow this same reporting schedule and should still submit a final program report at the end of each year that summarizes the NGOâs performance during the previous year. The Bureau suggests that NGOs receiving PRM funding use the PRM recommended quarterly program report template.Â  The suggested PRM NGO reporting template is designed to ease the reporting requirements while ensuring that all required elements are addressed.Â  The Quarterly Program Report Template can be requested by sending an email with only the phrase âPRM NGO Templatesâ (exactly as written,without the quotation marks) in the subject line, to PRMNGOCoordinator@state.gov.
Financial Reports: Financial reports are required within thirty (30) days following the end of each calendar year quarter during the validity period of the agreement (January 30th, April 30th, July 30th, October 30th).Â  The final financial report covering the entire period of the agreement is required within ninety (90) days after the expiration date of the agreement.Â  For agreements containing indirect costs, final financial reports are due within sixty (60) days of the finalization of the applicable negotiated indirect cost rate agreement (NICRA). Reports reflecting expenditures for the recipientâs overseas and United States offices should be completed in accordance with the Federal Financial Report (FFR SF-425) and submitted electronically in the Department of Health and Human Servicesâ Payment Management System (HHS/PMS) and in accordance with other award specific requirements.Â  Detailed information pertaining to the Federal Financial Report including due dates, instruction manuals and access forms, is provided on the HHS/PMS website .
Audit Reports: When a recipient-contracted audit is not required because the Federal award amount is less than the $750,000 threshold, the Department may determine that an audit must be performed and the audit report must be submitted to the responsible grants office(r) for review, dissemination, and resolution as appropriate.Â  The cost of audits required under this policy may be charged either as an allowable direct cost to the award, or included in the organizations established indirect costs in the awardâs detailed budget.
